    https://www.scholarshipportal.com/
    \nA money-saving strategy that does not require postponing college is to apply to schools where you have
    unique characteristics they seek. For example, your ethnic background or low income.'''

            ad4 = '''Keep in mind that housing and other living costs will vary by location. If you choose to live
    off-campus, your living expenses are typically much less.'''

            ad5 = '''Another option is to work and study. Make your after-school and summer jobs count by going after
    high-paying work. To find high-paying work‚Äîparticularly in the summer when you may be free during
    business hours, seek out office jobs through temp agencies. If you cannot get a high-paying job, get a job
    that will keep your living expenses down.
    \nIf you are still in high school, start working now and save all your paychecks for college. Presumably,
    you are still living at home, which is low cost. You probably do not have high living expenses eating into
    your earnings as you will later on. Check if your high school has a program that will allow you to leave
    school at noon every day to go to work during your senior year. '''

            ad6 = '''Great question! I also have a few tips for managing finances while in college. If you are graduating early
    i.e. before 18 years of age, you parents will take care of your finances till you turn 18. If you are
    graduating when you are 18 or older, you would have to do that yourself. My first tip is to create a monthly budget.
    In fact, Auxilium provides a budgeting and expenses tracking feature which would be very handy while in college.'''

            ad7 = '''Tip #2: Minimise Student Debt. There are many ways in which you can minimise debt so that you don't
    graduate from college broke.
    1. Do not use your financial aid to fund things like a party in your dorm. You shoud spend on the right
    things. You should be aware of what you should use your money for. tuition, books, housing, and maybe
    food plans ‚Äì not social outings, parties & new clothes.
    \n2. Borrow Only What‚Äôs Required. Not every student heads off to school with a fully-funded college trust.
    If you need to take out student loans, remind yourself that the amount borrowed should be commensurate
    with the type of salary available once a degree is obtained. Even if your you do choose to borrow money
    for school, it should be for school.
    \n3. Fund Extras with a Job. Work-study positions usually offer the flexibility a student needs with the
    convenience of location, while off-campus positions frequently pay more.
    \n4. Funnel Extra Earnings to Loan Payments. While loans technically aren‚Äôt due until after graduation,
    paying them off while in school can help your save serious money when it comes to long-term interest.
    You should be an expert at exploring the ways your educational status can save money. Vendors, local
    venues, restaurants, and services near college campuses often offer student discounts that could save
    you big money during the first year.'''

            ad8 = '''Credit Card Companies expect freshmen to be careless with credit cards, racking up late
    fees and high interest payments. They often lure students in with college-centric offers, such as the
    promise of free concert tickets or free college swag. Freshmen should never sign up for a student credit
    card on a whim. Instead, you can talk about the pros and cons of different cards, set a reasonably low
    spending limit, and look for cards with points or cash back rewards.'''

            ad9 = '''My final advice is - avoid full-price textbooks. Textbooks are the budget breakers of college
    students everywhere, Your school‚Äôs bookstore is basically like a convenience store. It‚Äôs there, it‚Äôs easy to
    get to if you live on campus, and it has what you need. The trouble is you might not be
    getting the best price if you exclusively buy books, both used and new, from the bookstore. The books
    can be expensive. Look beyond the bookstore.

    Tools like Bookfinder.com or 'Capital One Shopping' search the web for the titles you need and
    show you which store has them for a better price.
    With the exception of rare books, used books are pretty much always going to be cheaper than new
    ones. Unless you need to buy the most recent edition of a book and the most recent edition was only
    published a month ago, you can get by with a secondhand copy. Many websites sell used textbooks.
    Some popular examples include:

    1. Amazon
    2. Chegg
    3. eCampus.com
    4. ValoreBooks
    5. AbeBooks.com
    6. CampusBooks
    7. Barnes & Noble
    8. sellbackyourBook.com

    If you‚Äôre shopping online for your books, pay attention to the notes included by the seller.
    Some used books have a lot of highlighting, underlining, or notes scribbled in the margins. I
    advise you to rent instead of buying.'''

            ad10 = '''The other option is to use the college library or go digital. You can join the 'Open Textbook
    Library' (https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks) The library consists of nearly 800 titles that have been
    faculty-reviewed and are available to students for free. Some professors even
    assign books exclusively from the library. But even if they don‚Äôt, you might find the book you need in
    the library without any effort from your instructor.

    \nA money-saving strategy that does not require postponing college is to apply to schools where you have
    unique characteristics they seek. For example, your ethnic background or low income.'''

            ad4 = '''Keep in mind that housing and other living costs will vary by location. If you choose to live
    off-campus, your living expenses are typically much less.'''

            ad5 = '''Another option is to work and study. Make your after-school and summer jobs count by going after
    high-paying work. To find high-paying work‚Äîparticularly in the summer when you may be free during
    business hours, seek out office jobs through temp agencies. If you cannot get a high-paying job, get a job
    that will keep your living expenses down.
    \nIf you are still in high school, start working now and save all your paychecks for college. Presumably,
    you are still living at home, which is low cost. You probably do not have high living expenses eating into
    your earnings as you will later on. Check if your high school has a program that will allow you to leave
    school at noon every day to go to work during your senior year. '''

            ad6 = '''Great question! I also have a few tips for managing finances while in college. If you are graduating early
    i.e. before 18 years of age, you parents will take care of your finances till you turn 18. If you are
    graduating when you are 18 or older, you would have to do that yourself. My first tip is to create a monthly budget.
    In fact, Auxilium provides a budgeting and expenses tracking feature which would be very handy while in college.'''

            ad7 = '''Tip #2: Minimise Student Debt. There are many ways in which you can minimise debt so that you don't
    graduate from college broke.
    1. Do not use your financial aid to fund things like a party in your dorm. You shoud spend on the right
    things. You should be aware of what you should use your money for. tuition, books, housing, and maybe
    food plans ‚Äì not social outings, parties & new clothes.
    \n2. Borrow Only What‚Äôs Required. Not every student heads off to school with a fully-funded college trust.
    If you need to take out student loans, remind yourself that the amount borrowed should be commensurate
    with the type of salary available once a degree is obtained. Even if your you do choose to borrow money
    for school, it should be for school.
    \n3. Fund Extras with a Job. Work-study positions usually offer the flexibility a student needs with the
    convenience of location, while off-campus positions frequently pay more.
    \n4. Funnel Extra Earnings to Loan Payments. While loans technically aren‚Äôt due until after graduation,
    paying them off while in school can help your save serious money when it comes to long-term interest.
    You should be an expert at exploring the ways your educational status can save money. Vendors, local
    venues, restaurants, and services near college campuses often offer student discounts that could save
    you big money during the first year.'''

            ad8 = '''Credit Card Companies expect freshmen to be careless with credit cards, racking up late
    fees and high interest payments. They often lure students in with college-centric offers, such as the
    promise of free concert tickets or free college swag. Freshmen should never sign up for a student credit
    card on a whim. Instead, you can talk about the pros and cons of different cards, set a reasonably low
    spending limit, and look for cards with points or cash back rewards.'''

            ad9 = '''My final advice is - avoid full-price textbooks. Textbooks are the budget breakers of college
    students everywhere, Your school‚Äôs bookstore is basically like a convenience store. It‚Äôs there, it‚Äôs easy to
    get to if you live on campus, and it has what you need. The trouble is you might not be
    getting the best price if you exclusively buy books, both used and new, from the bookstore. The books
    can be expensive. Look beyond the bookstore.

    Tools like Bookfinder.com or 'Capital One Shopping' search the web for the titles you need and
    show you which store has them for a better price.
    With the exception of rare books, used books are pretty much always going to be cheaper than new
    ones. Unless you need to buy the most recent edition of a book and the most recent edition was only
    published a month ago, you can get by with a secondhand copy. Many websites sell used textbooks.
    Some popular examples include:

    1. Amazon
    2. Chegg
    3. eCampus.com
    4. ValoreBooks
    5. AbeBooks.com
    6. CampusBooks
    7. Barnes & Noble
    8. sellbackyourBook.com

    If you‚Äôre shopping online for your books, pay attention to the notes included by the seller.
    Some used books have a lot of highlighting, underlining, or notes scribbled in the margins. I
    advise you to rent instead of buying.'''

            ad10 = '''The other option is to use the college library or go digital. You can join the 'Open Textbook
    Library' (https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks) The library consists of nearly 800 titles that have been
    faculty-reviewed and are available to students for free. Some professors even
    assign books exclusively from the library. But even if they don‚Äôt, you might find the book you need in
    the library without any effort from your instructor.

    > Adding the monthly payments for all other debts.

    You do not have to pay the exact minimum amount. I advise you to pay more than the

    2. Create an emergency fund. The suggested amount to have in an emergency fund is three to six
       months' worth of expenses. If that amount isn't possible, aim for one months' worth, which is
       still a good starting point.

    you start working for, you might be offered next to nothing in the way of benefits or you might be
    offered everything from health insurance to life insurance to disability income insurance and more.
    Here are some things to consider while thinking about them:
    1. Life Insurance
       With the likelihood that you will change jobs several times in your 20s and 30s, getting life
       insurance through your employer may not be your best option. es, it may be your cheapest option
       ‚Äî your employer might offer life insurance with a death benefit of one, two, or three times your
       annual salary as a free or inexpensive employee benefit ‚Äî but if you leave the company, you
       usually will not be able to take your policy with you.
       While you may not need life insurance in your 20s in the sense that you may not yet have a spouse
       or children who depend on your income, buying at least a small, inexpensive term life insurance
       policy could be a smart move so that you know you have established a baseline of coverage,
       regardless of what happens with your health or your job, if you do end up having dependents.
       here are many types of life insurance available at different price points, so even if you do
       not have much disposable income, you may be able to find an affordable policy that offers a
       good value in terms of coverage, especially if you are a nonsmoker with a healthy weight.

    2. Disability Income Insurance
       Disability income insurance provides can protect a portion of your income if you are too sick
       or injured to work. You may not be able to take an employer-sponsored disability insurance
       policy with you when you change jobs, and the coverage your employer offers might not provide
       as much financial protection as you would like. Private disability insurance may provide more
       liberal benefits, and you can customize the policy to your needs. You can choose the amount
       of coverage, within limits based on your income, and you can decide how long you would be
       willing to wait before benefits would reap ‚Äî for example, three months versus six months'''

            ad7 = '''Most large employers will give you the ability to choose between several types
    of health insurance plans. Each plan comes with its own benefits and drawbacks, depending on
    your anticipated needs and healthcare costs. Type of plans:
    PPO ‚Äî A PPO, or preferred provider organization, is a health plan where you have the ability
          to choose your own healthcare providers. If you choose a doctor in the insurer's
          preferred provider network, you will get additional discounts and savings. If you choose
          a provider outside of the network, you will get reduced benefits. PPOs give you more
          flexibility to see whichever doctor you want, whenever you want, often without a referral.
          You will pay less when you choose an in-network provider, but you can choose to see an
          out-of-network provider, although you will pay more than if you received your care
          in-network.
          
    HMO ‚Äî An HMO, or health maintenance organisation, is a healthcare provider in which your
          insurance company is your primary healthcare provider. Your doctors are employees of the
          same company that offers your insurance. You have fewer options when choosing a doctor,
          and are generally required to receive all care, outside of emergency situations, through
          the HMO in order to receive insurance coverage.

    If you choose an HMO, or health maintenance organization, your premiums may be lower than those
    for a PPO, but you will lose flexibility: you will have to see your designated primary care
    doctor first when you need a referral to a specialist. HMOs also limit you to in-network
    providers, but the price you will pay for a doctor visit is fixed.
    If you choose a PPO, your employer may offer a choice between a high deductible plan with
    low premiums, which can save you money if you are healthy and anticipate few doctor visits, and
    a low deductible plan with higher premiums, which may save you money if you have a pre-existing
    condition or are a woman planning to get pregnant in the upcoming year.

    According to Investopedia, insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which an individual
    or entity receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company.
    There many types of insurance policies. There are many types of insurance such as life insurance,
    motor insurance, Health insurance, travel insurance, property insurance etc.
    Why do we need insurance?
    1. Insurance ensures family's financial stability
       No matter how much you have managed to save or what your monthly income is, an unexpected event
       can burn a huge hole in your pocket or can simply jeopardize your family‚Äôs financial future. For
       example, if you do not have adequate life insurance, your family might have to go through
       financial hardship if you were to meet with an untimely death. Though no amount of money can
       replace the loss of loved ones, having life insurance would save them from going through financial
       hardship. 
    2. Insurance reduces stress during difficult times.
       The premium you pay to the insurance company is the price that guarantees that the insurance
       company will cover the damage in case of an unforeseen event. And, that guarantee that your risk
       is covered brings peace of mind. '''
            
            ad2 = '''Definition of terms:
    Policy:
    A legal contract between you and the insurer. It details what risks are covered, under what
    circumstances the insurer will make a payment to you, how much money and what type of benefit
    you will receive if you make a claim.

    Policyholder:
    The insured or the person covered under the policy.

    Coverage:
    The amount of protection you have bought. It is also the maximum amount the insurance company
    will pay you if you make a claim for loss or event covered by your policy.

    Benefit:
    The amount the insurer will pay you if the insurer accepts your claim.

    Premium:
    The amount you pay for the insurance.

    Cash value:
    This is the amount the insurer pays to the policyholder when a life insurance policy is
    cancelled. It can also be an amount added to the death benefit and can be paid upon the
    insured‚Äôs death. This term is used with permanent life insurance policies.

    Death benefit:
    The amount the insurer will pay the beneficiary or beneficiaries upon the insured‚Äôs death.

    Claim:
    This is the official notice to your insurer to be paid for a loss or event covered by your insurance policy.

    Beneficiary:
    This is the person or entity the insured names or assigns to receive the proceeds of the
    policy. A beneficiary can be revocable (can be changed at any time without informing the
    beneficiary) or irrevocable (can‚Äôt be changed without the beneficiary‚Äôs written permission).

    Deductible:
    The amount you agree to pay before the insurer pays the rest.

    Exclusions:
    Things that are not covered by your policy. For example, some health insurance policies may
    exclude certain medical conditions you had before you applied for insurance or a travel
    insurance policy may exclude claims if you travel to a high-risk country. This is why it
    is important to read your policy thoroughly to check what it covers and what it doesn‚Äôt
    cover so that there will be no surprises when the time to claim comes.

    Risk:
    The probability or likelihood that an insured event, such as loss, injury or death, will
    happen while the policy is in effect.

    Rider:
    It is a clause or term added to your insurance policy to provide protection. This has an additional
    cost because it covers risks not covered in the basic policy.

    Term:
    The time period you are covered by your policy.

    Grace period:
    10 days immediately following the day you purchase an insurance policy, during which you may
    cancel the policy for a full refund of any premiums paid'''

            ad3 = '''When people buy insurance, they put their money into a pool with many others. Some of that
    pool of money helps the policyholders who suffer a hardship in that period. The hardship can be related
    to home, motor or business losses. You are covered only for losses written in your contract, and not for
    predictable events. When a hardship occurs, a claim is made. This is an official request for the insurer to
    pay for a covered loss. The insured's agent can assist in claiming benefits. Supporting documents/
    evidence will be required, depending on the type of loss (for example, pictures of an injury or property
    damage for an accident or property insurance claim, or a death certificate for a life insurance claim)
    during investigation of claims.'''

            ad4 = '''There are 3 important insurances:
    1. Life Insurance:
       Life insurance financially protects your family in case you die an early death. You pay a regular
       premium to the insurance company for a specific number of years. In return the insurance
       company pays a sum assured to your family if you die during the policy tenure.
       There are two types of life insurance:
       > Term ‚Äì provides coverage for a specific amount of time. If the insured dies within the period
                of coverage(and the premiums are paid), the beneficiary receives the death benefit as
                stated in the policy. The coverage ends at the specified term. It can be renewed after
                the term, however, the premium may increase since premiums may depend on the insured's
                age.
       > Permanent ‚Äì it covers the insured throughout their lifetime (unless the insured fails to pay
                     the premiums).
                     There are two kinds:
                     o Whole life insurance ‚Äì this guarantees that your premiums will not change as you
                                              get older. This type of insurance has a guaranteed minimum
                                              cash value and deatH benefit amount.
                     o Universal life insurance ‚Äì this is a product combining life insurance and
                                                  investment.

    2.Health Insurance:
    Health insurance can help you pay for services that the provincial health care plan does not cover.
    Some types can supplement your income if you suffer a major illness or injury. Other types can pay
    for medical expenses if you become ill while on vacation.
    Health insurance can be tricky to navigate. Managed care insurance plans require policyholders to
    receive care from a network of designated healthcare providers for the highest level of coverage.
    There are 4 main types of insurance plans:
     - Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)
       A Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, provides employers or groups a way to take care of
       all their employees' or members' health care needs with reduced costs by negotiating with
       specific doctors, hospitals, and clinics. Your doctors are employees of the same company that
       offers your insurance. You have fewer options when choosing a doctor, and are generally required
       to receive all care, outside of emergency situations, through the HMO in order to receive insurance
       coverage. The employee must use these specific providers for the reduced fees to be provided to
       their medical insurance plan. In an HMO plan, you have the least flexibility but will likely have
       the easiest claims experiences since the network takes care of putting in the claims for you.
       
     - Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)
       A PPO, or preferred provider organization, is a health plan where you have the ability to choose
       your own healthcare providers. If you choose a doctor in the insurer's preferred provider network,
       you will get additional discounts and savings. If you choose a provider outside of the network, you
       will get reduced benefits. PPOs give you more flexibility to see whichever doctor you want, whenever
       you want, often without a referral. You will pay less when you choose an in-network provider, but you
       can choose to see an out-of-network provider, although you will pay more than if you received your
       care in-network.

     - Point of Service Plan (POS)
       With a POS, members can choose their physician that has previously agreed to provide services at a
       discounted fee. In a POS, the member uses the chosen physician as a gateway before moving on to a
       specialist. Whenever the employee has a medical issue, the POS physician must be contacted first
       to obtain the most benefit from the health insurance plan.
       
     - Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)
       With an EPO, you may have a moderate amount of freedom to choose your health care providers -
       more than an HMO; you do not have to get a referral from a primary care doctor to see a
       specialist. There is no coverage for out-of-network providers; if you see a provider that is
       not in your plan‚Äôs network ‚Äì other than in an emergency ‚Äì you will have to pay the full cost
       yourself. EPO has a lower premium than a PPO offered by the same insurer.

     - High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) 
       An HDHP is generally similar to a PPO. However, these plans have a high deductible that you must
       meet before your plan will begin to pay a portion of your costs. A high deductible plan typically
       has a lower monthly premium but higher out of pocket costs.

    3. Liability Insurance
    Such insurance is availed to insure properties, cars, businesses, etc. On buying a liability insurance -
    like car insurance, home insurance, business insurance, in case of any damage to the insured object or
    property during the policy tenure, the insurance company will financially compensate the owner of the
    policyholder. 
    '''

            ad5 = '''Insurers will evaluate whether they can issue a policy based on certain criteria such as:
     - Age
     - Medical history
     - Previous claims made
     - Amount of coverage you are requesting
    Some types of insurance, such as life insurance, would require a medical exam. After which, the insurer
    would review your application and access your personal and medical history to assess your risk. After
    this assessment, you will know the amount of coverage you are qualified for and the premiums you need
    to pay. No matter what type of insurance you are applying for, answer all questions on the application
    fully and honestly. If you withhold important information or if you lie on the application, it can be
    the basis for cancelling your policy, or worse, refusing your claim in the future.'''

            ad6 = '''These conditions apply to most insurance policies:
     - Insurance does not cover deliberate damage caused by the insured person.
     - Insurance covers only the time period stated in the contract.
     - You may not be covered if you do not mitigate the damage‚Äîthat is, take reasonable steps to prevent
       the damage from becoming worse. For example, if your home is being damaged from water leaking
       from the roof, and you do not cover the hole, your coverage may be limited.
     - Compensation is usually based on the actual cash value of the property, when the damage occurred.
       For example, if your ten-year-old car is stolen, you will be compensated for the value of the used
       car, not for the value of a new one.
     - You must inform the insurer of any factors that might affect the risks that the policy covers.
       The insurer could refuse to compensate you if you misrepresent the risks.
     - Insurance may become void if you do not pay your premiums on time.

            ad7 = '''Here are a few tips while buying insurance:
    1. Purchase life insurance.
    Life insurance is essential, no matter how young or old you are. Buying now may be a smart move because
    it's cheaper to buy a life insurance policy when you're young and healthy. This kind of insurance can
    help your family cover unexpected costs in your absence, including student loan debt or a mortgage,
    in addition to end-of-life costs.'

    2. When looking for insurance, your top priority should be to find adequate coverage. Price is
    important, but you'll want to determine what kind of coverage you need first. You may be tempted
    to choose insurance with the lowest price tag, but if you don't have enough coverage
    (or the right kind of coverage), you will see less financial benefit when it comes time to file a
    claim.

    3. An independent insurance agent is an essential resource when purchasing insurance ‚Äî especially
    if this is your first time. orking with an independent agent can help make sure that you are getting
    the best coverage, for the best price. You‚Äôll also benefit from independent agents‚Äô insurance knowledge;
    they know how to talk you through your options and actually explain what each policy includes.
    An independent agent will make sure all of your assets are covered, help you find discounts or other ways
    to save, and be a valuable resource as your life changes and your insurance needs change, too.

       you will get additional discounts and savings. If you choose a provider outside of the network, you
       will get reduced benefits. PPOs give you more flexibility to see whichever doctor you want, whenever
       you want, often without a referral. You will pay less when you choose an in-network provider, but you
       can choose to see an out-of-network provider, although you will pay more than if you received your
       care in-network.

     - Point of Service Plan (POS)
       With a POS, members can choose their physician that has previously agreed to provide services at a
       discounted fee. In a POS, the member uses the chosen physician as a gateway before moving on to a
       specialist. Whenever the employee has a medical issue, the POS physician must be contacted first
       to obtain the most benefit from the health insurance plan.
       
     - Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)
       With an EPO, you may have a moderate amount of freedom to choose your health care providers -
       more than an HMO; you do not have to get a referral from a primary care doctor to see a
       specialist. There is no coverage for out-of-network providers; if you see a provider that is
       not in your plan‚Äôs network ‚Äì other than in an emergency ‚Äì you will have to pay the full cost
       yourself. EPO has a lower premium than a PPO offered by the same insurer.

     - High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) 
       An HDHP is generally similar to a PPO. However, these plans have a high deductible that you must
       meet before your plan will begin to pay a portion of your costs. A high deductible plan typically
       has a lower monthly premium but higher out of pocket costs.

    3. Liability Insurance
    Such insurance is availed to insure properties, cars, businesses, etc. On buying a liability insurance -
    like car insurance, home insurance, business insurance, in case of any damage to the insured object or
    property during the policy tenure, the insurance company will financially compensate the owner of the
    policyholder. 
    '''

            ad5 = '''Insurers will evaluate whether they can issue a policy based on certain criteria such as:
     - Age
     - Medical history
     - Previous claims made
     - Amount of coverage you are requesting
    Some types of insurance, such as life insurance, would require a medical exam. After which, the insurer
    would review your application and access your personal and medical history to assess your risk. After
    this assessment, you will know the amount of coverage you are qualified for and the premiums you need
    to pay. No matter what type of insurance you are applying for, answer all questions on the application
    fully and honestly. If you withhold important information or if you lie on the application, it can be
    the basis for cancelling your policy, or worse, refusing your claim in the future.'''

            ad6 = '''These conditions apply to most insurance policies:
     - Insurance does not cover deliberate damage caused by the insured person.
     - Insurance covers only the time period stated in the contract.
     - You may not be covered if you do not mitigate the damage‚Äîthat is, take reasonable steps to prevent
       the damage from becoming worse. For example, if your home is being damaged from water leaking
       from the roof, and you do not cover the hole, your coverage may be limited.
     - Compensation is usually based on the actual cash value of the property, when the damage occurred.
       For example, if your ten-year-old car is stolen, you will be compensated for the value of the used
       car, not for the value of a new one.
     - You must inform the insurer of any factors that might affect the risks that the policy covers.
       The insurer could refuse to compensate you if you misrepresent the risks.
     - Insurance may become void if you do not pay your premiums on time.
      (canada.ca)'''

            ad7 = '''Here are a few tips while buying insurance:
    1. Purchase life insurance.
    Life insurance is essential, no matter how young or old you are. Buying now may be a smart move because
    it's cheaper to buy a life insurance policy when you're young and healthy. This kind of insurance can
    help your family cover unexpected costs in your absence, including student loan debt or a mortgage,
    in addition to end-of-life costs.'

    2. When looking for insurance, your top priority should be to find adequate coverage. Price is
    important, but you'll want to determine what kind of coverage you need first. You may be tempted
    to choose insurance with the lowest price tag, but if you don't have enough coverage
    (or the right kind of coverage), you will see less financial benefit when it comes time to file a
    claim.

    3. An independent insurance agent is an essential resource when purchasing insurance ‚Äî especially
    if this is your first time. orking with an independent agent can help make sure that you are getting
    the best coverage, for the best price. You‚Äôll also benefit from independent agents‚Äô insurance knowledge;
    they know how to talk you through your options and actually explain what each policy includes.
    An independent agent will make sure all of your assets are covered, help you find discounts or other ways
    to save, and be a valuable resource as your life changes and your insurance needs change, too.

    that help grow your money. With more years ahead, you can reap maximum benefits on your investments,
    provided you first understand and evaluate different aspects of what investment is and then start early. '''

            ad5 = '''Yes they are. Here is a risk ladder for investments which shows
    major asset classes in ascending order of risk:

    Cash
    A cash bank deposit is the simplest, most easily understandable investment asset ‚Äî and the safest.
    Not only does it give investors precise knowledge of the interest they will earn, but it also
    guarantees they will get their capital back. On the downside, the interest earned from cash put away
    in a savings account rarely beats inflation. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are highly liquid instruments,
    very similar to cash which are instruments that typically provide higher interest rates than those in
    savings accounts. However, the money is locked up for a while, and there are potential early withdrawal
    penalties involved.

    Bonds
    A bond is a debt apparatus representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower. A typical bond will
    involve either a corporation or a government agency where the borrower will issue a fixed interest rate
    to the lender in exchange for using their capital. Bonds are common in organizations that use them
    to finance operations, purchases, or other projects. Bond rates are essentially determined by interest
    rates. Due to this, they are heavily traded during periods of quantitative easing or when the
    Federal Reserve‚Äîor other central banks‚Äîraise interest rates.

    Mutual Funds
    A mutual fund is a type of investment where more than an investor pools their money to
    purchase securities. Mutual funds are not necessarily passive as they are managed by portfolio
    managers who designate and distribute the pooled investment into stocks, bonds, and other
    securities. Individuals may invest in mutual funds for as little as $1,000 per share, letting
    them expand into as many as 100 different stocks included within a given portfolio. Mutual funds
    are sometimes designed to simulate underlying indexes such as the S&P 500 or DOW Industrial Index.
    Many mutual funds are actively managed, meaning they are updated by portfolio managers who carefully
    track and adjust their allocations within the fund. However, these funds generally have greater
    costs‚Äîsuch as yearly management fees and front-end charges‚Äîwhich can cut into an investor's returns.
    Mutual funds are valued at the end of the trading day and all buy and sell transactions are likewise
    executed after the market closes.Ôªø

    Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
    Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become quite attractive since their introduction back in the
    mid-1990s. ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but they trade throughout the day, on a stock exchange. In
    this way, they mirror the buy-and-sell behaviour of stocks. This also means their value can change
    drastically during a trading day. ETFs can track an underlying index such as the S&P 500 or any other
    'basket' of stocks the issuer of the ETF wants to underline a specific ETF with. This can include anything
    from emerging markets, commodities, individual business sectors such as biotechnology or agriculture, and
    more. Due to the ease of trading and broad coverage, ETFs are extremely popular with investors.

    Stocks
    Shares of stock let investors participate in the company‚Äôs success via raises in the stock‚Äôs price and
    through dividends. Shareholders have a claim on the company‚Äôs assets in the event of liquidation
    (that is, the company going bankrupt) but do not own the assets. Holders of common stock enjoy voting
    rights at shareholders' meetings. Holders of preferred stock do not have voting rights, but they do
    receive preference over common shareholders in terms of the dividend payments.

    Alternative Investments
    There is a vast world of alternative investments, including the following sectors:
    Real estate: Investors can acquire real estate by directly buying commercial or residential properties.
    Alternatively, they can purchase shares in real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs act like
    mutual funds wherein a group of investors pool their money together to purchase properties. They
    trade like stocks on the same exchange.

        Hedge funds and private equity funds:
        Hedge funds, which may invest in a variety of assets designed to deliver beyond market returns,
        called 'alpha.' However, performance is not guaranteed, and hedge funds can see unimaginable
        shifts in returns, sometimes underperforming the market by a significant margin. Typically only
        available to certified investors, these vehicles (assets offered by the investment industry to
        help investors move money from the present to the future, with the hope of increasing the value
        of their money) often require high initial investments of $1 million or more. They also tend to
        impose net worth requirements. Both investment types may tie up an investor's money for
        substantial periods.

        Commodities: Commodities refer to physical resources such as gold, silver, crude oil, as well as
        agricultural products.

    '''

            ad6 = '''Some tips for investing are:
    1. Set investment Goals
       You have to decide what you want to get out of investing? Consider things like income, capital
       appreciation, and safety of capital. Also, consider your age, your personal circumstances, and
       your financial position.

    2. Invest Early
       I have covered this before.

    3. Be cautious of commissions
       Some professionals are well known for selling products that pay them big commissions, but don't
       pay much to their buyers. They would talk you into buying investments that give them high
       commissions. Do some research before considering the investment.

    4. Diversify your investments
       You should have a diversified portfolio to avoid losing a lot of money when stocks go down.
       This way, you will have some stocks that are rising, even when others are falling.

    5. Make investments automatic
       Set aside a certain amount of money to be automatically invested each month. You can set up
       automatic investment plans through various brokerage service firms and automated investment
       services available. This way, you will avoid stalling and consistently invest.

    Alternative Investments
    There is a vast world of alternative investments, including the following sectors:
    Real estate: Investors can acquire real estate by directly buying commercial or residential properties.
    Alternatively, they can purchase shares in real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs act like
    mutual funds wherein a group of investors pool their money together to purchase properties. They
    trade like stocks on the same exchange.

        Hedge funds and private equity funds:
        Hedge funds, which may invest in a variety of assets designed to deliver beyond market returns,
        called 'alpha.' However, performance is not guaranteed, and hedge funds can see unimaginable
        shifts in returns, sometimes underperforming the market by a significant margin. Typically only
        available to certified investors, these vehicles (assets offered by the investment industry to
        help investors move money from the present to the future, with the hope of increasing the value
        of their money) often require high initial investments of $1 million or more. They also tend to
        impose net worth requirements. Both investment types may tie up an investor's money for
        substantial periods.

        Commodities: Commodities refer to physical resources such as gold, silver, crude oil, as well as
        agricultural products.

            ad6 = '''Some tips for investing are:
    1. Set investment Goals
       You have to decide what you want to get out of investing? Consider things like income, capital
       appreciation, and safety of capital. Also, consider your age, your personal circumstances, and
       your financial position.

    2. Invest Early
       I have covered this before.

    3. Be cautious of commissions
       Some professionals are well known for selling products that pay them big commissions, but don't
       pay much to their buyers. They would talk you into buying investments that give them high
       commissions. Do some research before considering the investment.

    4. Diversify your investments
       You should have a diversified portfolio to avoid losing a lot of money when stocks go down.
       This way, you will have some stocks that are rising, even when others are falling.

    5. Make investments automatic
       Set aside a certain amount of money to be automatically invested each month. You can set up
       automatic investment plans through various brokerage service firms and automated investment
       services available. This way, you will avoid stalling and consistently invest.

    I hope I have helped you! If you are not satisfied, please meet a financial advisor in our nearest
    Auxilium branch who can help you more. If you need me, I'm here!'''
